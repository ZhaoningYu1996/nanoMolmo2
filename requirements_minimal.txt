# Minimal Requirements for Pure PyTorch Implementation
# nanoMolmo2 - Educational VLM with minimal dependencies

# Core Deep Learning (REQUIRED)
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0

# Data Processing (REQUIRED)
numpy>=1.24.0
pillow>=10.0.0

# Video Processing (REQUIRED for video datasets)
opencv-python>=4.8.0

# Data Format (OPTIONAL but recommended)
pyarrow>=14.0.0  # For reading parquet files from HuggingFace

# Progress Bars (OPTIONAL)
tqdm>=4.66.0

# Logging (OPTIONAL)
tensorboard>=2.14.0

# =============================================================================
# NOT NEEDED (Pure PyTorch implementation):
# - transformers (we implement models from scratch)
# - datasets (we implement dataloaders from scratch)
# - accelerate (we write training loop from scratch)
# - deepspeed (optional, can add later for distributed training)
# =============================================================================

# Total core dependencies: 5 packages
# torch, torchvision, numpy, pillow, opencv-python
